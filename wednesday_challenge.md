# CHALLENGE LAB 05:
## DICTIONARIES, VARIABLES, INPUT, SHEBANG

0. Create a new script!

0. Include a shebang line.

0. Make your file executable with a ./

0. Save a user's input to the variable `char_name` from the following question:

        Which character do you want to know about? (Flash, Batman, Superman)

0. Save a user's input to the variable `char_stat` from the following question:

        What statistic do you want to know about? (strength, speed, or intelligence)

0. Use the char_name and char_stat values to pull the appropriate value from the dictionary below.

        {"flash":{"speed": "fastest", "intelligence": "lowest", "strength": "lowest"}, "batman":{"speed": "slowest", "intelligence": "Highest", "strength": "Money"}, "superman":{"speed": "fast, "intelligence": "average", "strength": "strongest"}}

0. Create a print function that combines that information into this output:

        <char_name>'s <char_stat> is: <value>

**BONUS:** When returning the hero's name, have it capitalized appropriately (e.g. Flash, not flash)

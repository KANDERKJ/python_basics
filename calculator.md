## FUNCTIONS CHALLENGE
### Make a calculator that takes two integers and adds/subtracts/divides/multiplies them!

0. Create a FUNCTION which accepts three arguments: 

  • a float/integer
  
  • another float/integer
  
  • an operator (add, subtract, divide, multiply)
  
  > example: calculator(int1, int2, operator)
  
0. Allow a user to make input for all three arguments.

**BONUS 1:** Make the script human-error proof. Use IF/ELIF/ELSE and TRY/EXCEPT where necessary!

**BONUS 2:** If the user types in a bad input, have them type it in again! Use a WHILE LOOP!

**BONUS 3:** Make your function call a SECOND function (the purpose of which is up to you!)

## FUNCTIONS CHALLENGE
### Make a calculator that takes two integers and adds/subtracts/divides/multiplies them!

1. Use FUNCTIONS to create a calculator! Your script must accept the following user input: 

      - a float/integer
      - another float/integer
      - an operator (add, subtract, divide, multiply)
  
0. Your script should return the answer!

**BONUS 1:** Make the script human-error proof. Use IF/ELIF/ELSE and TRY/EXCEPT where necessary!

**BONUS 2:** If the user types in a bad input, have them type it in again! Use a WHILE LOOP!

Upload your script to GitHub and send Chad the link in-chat! Once Chad's confirmed it, you may call it a night!

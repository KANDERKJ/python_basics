## Lab 22 "Looping with for" Challenge!

```
farms = [{"name": "NE Farm", "agriculture": ["sheep", "cows", "pigs", "chickens", "llamas", "cats"]},
         {"name": "W Farm", "agriculture": ["pigs", "chickens", "llamas"]},
         {"name": "SE Farm", "agriculture": ["chickens", "carrots", "celery"]}]
```

### EASY(ish):

• Write a for loop that returns all the animals from the NE Farm!

### MEDIUM:

• Ask a user to choose a farm (NE Farm, W Farm, or SE Farm). Return the plants/animals that are raised on that farm.

### HARD:

• Ask a user to choose a farm (NE Farm, W Farm, or SE Farm). Return the plants/animals that are raised on that farm.

• ...but only return ANIMALS from that particular farm.
